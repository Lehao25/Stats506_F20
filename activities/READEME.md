## Activities

This directory contains instructions and supporting material
for in class activities.

### week1

In week1 (September 8) we worked on a Linux Shell Activity. Most groups
made it through at least 4 steps of Part 1, and will be given some additonal
time to finish on September 15 after the week 2 activity.  The script created
will be use in week3, so please keep a copy handy.

The files in this folder are briefly described below:

 1. `README.md` - this is the main set of directions, called `READEME.md` as this
   is what to call files to be displayed when visiting the directory.

 1. `week1_part1.sh` - this is a (slightly edited) version of the template script
    for part 1 of the activity.

 1. `week1_part2_args.sh` - this a template for getting stated on part 2. It is ok
    if groups do not complete part .

 1. `week1_part1_solution.sh` - is not there yet, but will be posted after Sep 15.
