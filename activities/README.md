## Activities

This directory contains instructions and supporting material
for in class activities.

### Week 1

In week 1 (September 8) we worked on a Linux Shell Activity. Most groups
made it through at least 4 steps of Part 1, and will be given some additonal
time to finish on September 15 after the week 2 activity.  The script created
will be use in week3, so please keep a copy handy.

The files in this folder are briefly described below:

 1. `README.md` - this is the main set of directions, called `READEME.md` as this
   is what to call files to be displayed when visiting the directory.

 1. `week1_part1.sh` - this is a (slightly edited) version of the template script
    for part 1 of the activity.

 1. `week1_part2_args.sh` - this a template for getting stated on part 2. It is ok
    if groups do not complete part .

 1. `week1_part1_solution.sh` - is not there yet, but will be posted after Sep 15.

### Week 2

In week 2 we will reason about and answer questions on R code. In doing so, the
goal is to help you synthesize concepts including:

 - broadcasting
 - type promotion
 - function scoping
 - the data.frame class and its relation to lists
 - syntax for control flow and conditional evaluation
 - the arithmetic operators `%%` and `%/%`
 - finite precision of floating point arithmetic.

The activity will be structured as follows:

  1. discuss each question in groups (breakout rooms)
  1. individually respond to a poll for each question and
     then discuss as a whole class
  1. return to group discussions, debrief previous question,
     discuss next question, repeat. 

After dicussing all questions, time will be alloted to complete the
week 1 activity.

### Week 3
Details to come Sep 22.
