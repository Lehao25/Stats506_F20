## ![](../../icons/reading.png){width='25px'} Reading

Everyone should read:

  - [Github flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)
  - Chapter 27 of *R For Data Science* [Rmarkdown](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)
  - Sections 29.1-29.4 in Chapter 29 of *R For Data Science* 
    [Rmarkdown formats](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html)
    
Optional reading:

  - Learn more about Rmarkdown from
    [Get Started](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) on its
    homepage. There is some overlap with Chapter 27 of *R4DS*. 
  - Michael Clark's 
    ["Rmarkdown"](https://m-clark.github.io/Introduction-to-Rmarkdown/)
  - [Spin](https://deanattali.com/2015/03/24/knitrs-best-hidden-gem-spin/) 
    I like to build reports and write markdown directly from R scripts (`.R`).
  - The [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)
    package is incredibly useful for rendering professional looking tables.

## ![](../../icons/reading.png){width='25px'} Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a plain text formatting 
language designed to create html documents using plain text and
indentation to specify the desired format
while remaining easy to read in its raw format. Thanks to the magic of
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) Markdown can also be used to create PDF, MS Word,
and other types of documents. 

There are many "flavors" of markdown, but they all implement the core idea of 
using simple plain text formats to specify the desired markup.  For this course
the two most relevant markdown "flavors" are 
[Github flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)
and [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## ![](../../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Rmarkdown

This document was written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
using RStudio. You can see the source at 
[Stats506_F20](https://github.com/jbhender/Stats506_F20/tree/master/examples).

You will use Rmarkdown for all assignments in the course.  To begin, you should
familiarize yourself with the basic formatting options specified under 
"Examples" from [Github flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

In addition, you should learn to:
  
  a. Knit your R markdown documents using a shortcut key, i.e. 
     `cmd+shift+enter` or `ctrl+shift+enter`
  
  a. Knit programmatically using `rmarkdown::render()`. 
  
  a. Include plots and tables (`knitr::kable()`) in your documents.

Templates for problem sets are available at
[Stats506_F20](https://github.com/jbhender/Stats506_F20/tree/master/problem_sets/templates).

## ![](../../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} `LaTex`

You can include math in your Rmarkdown documents using `LaTex`. `LaTex` is a 
typesetting program and markup language popular for writing scientific articles,
especially within the mathematical sciences. If you've never
used `LaTex` before, here are the basics.

 1. Use math inline by enclosing it between dollar signs. For instance,
    `$Y|X \sim \mathrm{N(X\beta, \sigma^2I_{n,n})}$` becomes 
    $Y|X \sim \mathrm{N(X\beta, \sigma^2I_{n,n})}$.

 1. Use escaped commands for special symbols, e.g. Greek letters `\Sigma` for
    $\Sigma$. 

 1. Create equation displays using a math mode environment `\[ \]`, e.g.
 
 ```Latex
 \[
  \begin{align}
  {n \choose k} &= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} \\
                &= \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n i}{ \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n-k} i \right)
                                           \left(\prod_{j=1}^k j \right) } \\
                &= \frac{ \prod_{i=(n-k+1)}^n i}{\prod_{j=1}^k j} \\
                &= \frac{ (n-k+1) \times \dots \times n}{2 \times \dots k}
  \end{align}
 \]
 ```
becomes
 \[
  \begin{align}
  {n \choose k} &= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} \\
                &= \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n i}{ \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n-k} i \right)
                                           \left(\prod_{j=1}^k j \right) } \\
                &= \frac{ \prod_{i=(n-k+1)}^n i}{\prod_{j=1}^k j} \\
                &= \frac{ (n-k+1) \times \dots \times n}
                   {2 \times \dots \times k}
  \end{align}
 \]

Those new to `LaTex` may also find the section 
[Math in Rmarkdown](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#math-in-r-markdown)
of Cosma Shalizi's Rmarkdown notes helpful. 

For a comprehensive list of symbols available in `LaTex` and their escaped 
commands refer to:
http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf

You also must have a `LaTex` distribution available for Pandoc to turn your 
markdown into a pdf document:  
<center> 
`.Rmd` $\rightarrow_{\mathrm{knitr}}$ `.md` $\rightarrow_{\mathrm{pandoc}}$
  `.tex` $\rightarrow_{\mathrm{LaTex}}$ `.pdf`.
</center>

## ![](../../icons/code_style.png){width='25px'} Style Notes

When using Rmarkdown for problem sets:

 - Separate problems from one another by:
   - For pdf documents, using page breaks in Latex: `\pagebreak`,
   - For HTML documents, using a horizontal rule MD: `---`, (Latex: `\hrule`).

 - Avoid using italics for functions when writing `LaTex`. Good: 
   `$\log x$` = $\log x$. Bad: `$log x$` = $log x$.

 - Label all R chunks in your Rmarkdown documents.  
 
 - Think carefully about use of chunk options, 
   e.g. `message`, `echo`, `include`.
   
 - Strive to submit professional looking, "polished" documents. Knit often and
   leave yourself time for one or two proofreading edits.
   
 - Do the bulk of your data processing and cleaning in R script (`.R`) and not
   in Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`). Analysis can also be done in an R script. 
   You can `source()` this script (or scripts) from the Rmarkdown document or 
   load in a clean data file.
