## Examples

This directory will be used to share code for examples presented during
lecture or referenced in the reading.  

1. [Rmarkdown.Rmd](./Rmarkdown.Rmd) - Source code for the Rmarkdown notes
   which you may find useful for learnig Rmarkdown.  Note that the icons are
   not included in this directory so you will need to remove reference to them
   if trying to render this example yourself.
