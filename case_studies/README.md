## Case studies

### Case studies using R

[1-tidyverse](./1-tidyverse) - Contains a collection of (mainly) R scripts for a case study
using the 2009 RECS data to compare home types by Census region, focusing on single-family
attached homes. The case study uses the [tidyverse](tidyverse.org) group of packages.  The
case study is meant to demonstrate the key features of dplyr, including pipes (`%>%`) and
the core dplyr verbs, pivoting data using tidyr, and creating plots with ggplot2.

### Case studies using Stata

[2-stata](./2-stata) - Contains Stata scripts (`.do`) for estimating national and regional
energy use of four distinct fuels using the 2015 RECS data.  The focus here is on Stata
syntax and data manipulation including merging and reshaping datasets, aggregation by group
using `collapse`, and how to work around the "one-data" principle within Stata.
